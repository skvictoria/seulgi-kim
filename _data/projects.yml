- project: A Vehicle Motion Intention Prediction based on Deep Learning
  role: Oral Presentation at Hyundai Motor Group Conference
  duration: 2021
  img_src: "images/freespace.png"
  img_explain: "2D Map of Drivable Surface"
  description: I developed <b>Perception based Planning system</b> by fusing 3D LiDAR with Camera. By predicting the following frames instead of planning and controlling per frames, the image latency problem can also be desolved. I won <b>Excellence Paper Certification</b> in Hyundai Motor Group Conference.

- project: Lv.3 Advanced Driver Assistance System
  role: Drivable Surface & Curb Detection Algorithm
  duration: 2022 &mdash; Present
